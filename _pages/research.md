## On the performance of time reversal underwater acoustic communication based on BELLHOP channel simulator.
In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) of time reversal (TR)-underwater acoustic communication (UAC) and non-TR-UAC is discussed, considering channel degrading effects, namely sound speed, multipath scattering, spreading and absorption. TR is a signal harvesting strategy that utilizes multipath to focus the signal waves' power in time and space. The results were obtained with the help of MATLAB simulation that interfaces with the specialized beam tracing software BELLHOP. Simulation results show that the BER performance of quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulated UAC systems varies due to variations in sound speed over space and time caused by different oceanic and atmospheric conditions. It was also observed that BER performs well in 0-400 m depth due to high sound speed compared to 400-1500 m depth. The multipath exploitation can be seen in TR-UAC as it performs better than non-TR-UAC systems.
